I built a combination analog/digital clock using JavaScript. This project provided a practical platform to apply core JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, time calculations, and event handling. By creating a dynamic clock face that accurately reflects the current time, I gained valuable insights into JavaScript's capabilities in creating interactive elements.
